2185. Counting Words With a Given Prefix
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.

Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100
words[i] and pref consist of lowercase English letters.
