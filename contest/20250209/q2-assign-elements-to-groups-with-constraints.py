Q2. Assign Elements to Groups with Constraints
Medium
4 pt.
You are given an integer array groups, where groups[i] represents the size of the ith group. You are also given an integer array elements.

Your task is to assign one element to each group based on the following rules:

An element j can be assigned to a group i if groups[i] is divisible by elements[j].
If there are multiple elements that can be assigned, assign the element with the smallest index j.
If no element satisfies the condition for a group, assign -1 to that group.
Return an integer array assigned, where assigned[i] is the index of the element chosen for group i, or -1 if no suitable element exists.

Note: An element may be assigned to more than one group.

 

Example 1:

Input: groups = [8,4,3,2,4], elements = [4,2]

Output: [0,0,-1,1,0]

Explanation:

elements[0] = 4 is assigned to groups 0, 1, and 4.
elements[1] = 2 is assigned to group 3.
Group 2 cannot be assigned any element.
Example 2:

Input: groups = [2,3,5,7], elements = [5,3,3]

Output: [-1,1,0,-1]

Explanation:

elements[1] = 3 is assigned to group 1.
elements[0] = 5 is assigned to group 2.
Groups 0 and 3 cannot be assigned any element.
Example 3:

Input: groups = [10,21,30,41], elements = [2,1]

Output: [0,1,0,1]

Explanation:

elements[0] = 2 is assigned to the groups with even values, and elements[1] = 1 is assigned to the groups with odd values.

 

Constraints:

1 <= groups.length <= 105
1 <= elements.length <= 105
1 <= groups[i] <= 105
1 <= elements[i] <= 105
