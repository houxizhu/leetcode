You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

Note: The meetings may overlap.



Example 1:

Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]
